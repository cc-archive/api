* Get basic 'webtest' WSGI-testing framework in place (make working tests)
* Port tests in test.py over to the Paste/WebTest framework
* Decide if utilities/relax_validate.py (apparently unit tests) belong in the new webtest framework

== Possible to do ==
* Port utilities/relax_validate.py unit tests as appropriate
* Organize /tests into 'unittest', 'functional', etc. categories

== Open questions ==
* Should this TODO.txt go in docs/ ?
* Should tests/ be moved to src/ ?
* What is the overall sanity scheme that we're sticking to?
* Does the path / local import code function?
** Is it still a holdover from the other directory structure?
** Or has it been run, and proven to work?
